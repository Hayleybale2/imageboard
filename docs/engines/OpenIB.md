# `OpenIB` API

[`OpenIB`](https://github.com/OpenIB/OpenIB) engine is a "security-focused" fork of [`infinity`](https://github.com/ctrlcctrlv/infinity) engine. Both engines haven't been maintained since 2020.

See the description of the [`infinity`](https://gitlab.com/catamphetamine/imageboard/blob/master/docs/engines/infinity.md) engine API.
